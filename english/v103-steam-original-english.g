     Her gorgeous eyes and slender build drew lots of fans.
     She’s been invited to every major motor show, solidifying her status.
     People view her as the image of high-end vehicles and rumors show that she is transitioning to be an entertainer."

    " Born in 1982, she worked as a graphic artist in the past.
     After watching a car race with her boyfriend, she fell in love with car racing.
     She grew tired of just watching all the racing games, so she quit her job and became a racer girl. "
girl3.desc
    " A married racer girl, you would never guess that was a mother of a 5-year old child from her good looks.
     After getting married to one of her fans, she returned to her racing career.
     Of course, she has loved all the support from her number one fan, her husband,
     but unlike the other racer girls, her female fanbase has rapidly increased after getting married. "

    " Born in 1986, she measures in at 172cm and a slender weight of 49kg.
     She’s an expert dancer that gained fame from a variety of reality TV and game shows.
     She also works as a fashion model,
     but views herself as a racer girl,
     and shares this view with most of her fans. "
girl5.desc
    " Born in 1983, she’s a rookie model who worked as a racer girl for only a year.
     She majored in Transport Designs but don't let that fool you. She's also great at driving, too taking home 1st place at an amateur racing club.
     Her long legs are her best feature giving her honors as the model with the best legs in her debut."

    " An aspiring model-to-be who majored in Korean Traditional Dance is currently training to become a model.
     She started her racer girl career for the experience in the spotlight, but the job was engaging enough for her to keep her attention.
     She’s giving it her all, but is still looking forward to the day she will debut as a fashion model. "
driver1.desc
    "A 20-year old who is striving to be the very best in whatever she does is currently part of a racing team working as an intern driver.
     He still needs more experience, but his talents show that he has potential to be a great driver.
     Luck doesn't win races; only practice will bring him to the top."
driver2.desc
    "A racer from the standard elite courses.
     Thanks to his father working at Keiberg Corp., he began cart racing at the age of 5.
     After growing up, he attended racing school and joined the Keiberg Junior Racing Team when he was only 14.
     While he didn’t achieve any notable records during cart racing or when on the junior racing team, his self-control and determination made him a promising racer at the age of 18.
     MMW saw his potential and signed him to their team when he qualified 3rd in the German Open Championship.
     Since moving to MMW, he has won numerous races at the height of his career.
     His driving style is very stable due to his tremendous experience and strong mental concentration.
     But some say his desire to win has been weakened.
     < Behind Story >
     His father, a mechanic for Keiberg, was a wannabe racer, but after an accident during a car test, his dream ended.
     He wanted Marco to fulfill his dream, so he invested everything in his son, Marco, even gaining the support of Keiberg Corp.
     So when Marco moved to MMW without winning the Gold Cup for Keiberg, his father became full of anguish."
driver3.desc
    "‘The rally rebel road challenger.’
     ESPN gave him that title which was front page news when he abruptly announced his retirement from his dominant reign at rally racing to focus on road racing.
     Apart from a year when he recovered from an horrendous accident, he dominated every competition since he started his career in rally racing at the age of 22.
     He currently is the 3-time, all-around winner of the WRC Rally and has won more than 50 various rallies such as the Rallye Monte Carlo and Dakar Rally.
     During interviews, he sometimes references that the race is only about competing against his car and that the other drivers aren’t even a factor at all, stirring the public.
     Outside of racing, his dysfunctional private life is full of scandals with famous celebrities, which makes him an easy target for the paparazzi.
     One time when he decided to ditch the paparazzi, he drove so fast that no one could keep up with him.
     This choice eventually ended up with Roman authorities revoking his driving license during his vacation.
     When he decided to "
        challenge the road
" he claimed that rally racing no longer had any challenge left, which baffled the public with his drastic decision.
 His situational awareness, swift reaction speed, and unorthodox driving style are his strongest skills, but it is still uncertain if his skills will transition well on the circuit.
 <Behind Story>
 There were a number of rumors that related to the reason why he left rally racing and moved to F1.
 Some thought that there were no more challenges left in rally racing for him, but others thought he was just agitated by all the rumors that he was only good at off-road racing.
 According to his co-driver and former partner for 3 years, Andrew, he met a woman named Anna during his vacation in Italy. When Martin became attracted to her, she told Martin that she would only date him if he could prove himself faster than her on the circuit. Martin responded to the claim that it was a stupid made up lie by Andrew, who was now jobless thanks to Martin. He also told the press that, "
    Andrew will never perform at that level again without me on his rally again.""

# Description of courses ##
course.Circuit01.desc
    "The track was originally used for test cars and later redesigned for racing. The two straight lines, each followed by corner give the driver the opportunity to shorten lap time. The first corner appearing right after start affects whole racing so you need high concentration in starting."
course.Circuit02.desc
    "The valley track winding with beautiful seaport is mended at times when the racing is held.It is much popular to galleries for outstanding views but it is also notorious to racers for narrow and tough valley track."
course.Circuit03.desc
    "You can feel the best speed along the road through the city streets. Though the difficulty level is medium, you should be careful of braking at the hairpin after long straight line. Long acceleration through continous straight lines makes the track very populur to galleries wishing to see best speed of the car."
course.Circuit04.desc
    "The track is very beautiful at glance from the middle of the mountain. At first, you can be mistaken that the track is easy except two hairpins, but because almost all the corners are blind corners meaning the next corner is not visible, the track has notorious nickname of Typhlopidae from the drivers."
course.Circuit05.desc
    "Though it is illegal, you can drive sling streets being repairing to prepare formula race. It is very dangerous because some parts of the road cause the optical illusion and there are many obstacles laid for repairing, but many young peoples are gathering here now to enjoy best speed."
course.Circuit06.desc "Cloudy Summit Reverse direction"
course.Circuit07.desc "Sundown Harbor is a great shipyard"
course.Circuit08.desc "Sundown Harbor-R is a great shipyard"
course.Circuit09.desc
    "The valley track winding with beautiful seaport is mended at times when the racing is held.It is much popular to galleries for outstanding views but it is also notorious to racers for narrow and tough valley track."
course.Circuit10.desc "XL Speedway was changed to jumpping course."

     Most believe that this came from the owners own personal history between each other.
     The rivalry of these two corporations had such a huge impact on the models and contributed to the growth of the Italian automobile industry.
     Stradi Corp. invested the majority of their budget into R&D to prove their technological superiority, which lead to their success development of the Griffone and struck a blow to Fermo Corp."

    "A made to order MR model from the Shuken Corp.
     The only MR-type from Shuken Corp. was widely known for its dynamic handling due to its ideal weight and balance.
     Its acceleration and stability were worthy of a supercar, and its sales were better than other models due to its wide range of options ranging from custom paint jobs to a variety of upgradable parts.
     On the other hand, due to the high sales, it could be seen on every street giving it the name 'Street.' But it became so famous that many tuning companies built newer models based on the original R450GT which performed just as well in various races."

     A number of racing teams contracted with Genève for their design. Genève manufacturing grew and so did the size of Group C. Among Group C, the XIX mounting of the Hestings engine performed the best.
     The GT550LM was a designed exclusively as a race car based on the body manufactured by Genève, with its performance matching that of a formula one car.
     Most of the specifics of the car were a closely guarded secret of the race team."

    "While not available in the public market, this high-end model from Shuken was built to show the world that the R450GT was a worthy competitor in any competition.
     Shuken periodically sent models to the JGTL, but this model reached the highest rankings within just 2 seasons. It also won several times during its 3rd season.
     Shuken had already solidified its position as a high-performance car company in Japan with the XL-3000 series, but the great performance by the R450GT at the JGTL enabled it to move its business overseas."

    "Drexxler, a company made famous by petroleum and not by making cars, was the hit of the 80's.
     When the WereWolf-GTi, the high-end vehicle from Drexxler earned a good reputation as a fantastic sports car, this model's design was based on the WereWolf with lower specs as a mass-produced high-performance sports car.
     With its sleek design and superb mobility, it was chosen by Americans as one of the top 20 classic cars of 1980.
     While having huge success in America, it didn't fare so well in Europe due to Europe's awful traffic and terrible gas mileage.
     While it was a great car back in the day, its slower transmission and the American style of soft suspension, it had some difficulties transitioning to present-day racing."

     It made its current brand successful by maintaining a distinct design in the midst of its competition with Stradi and Fermo.
     The FT12 contributed to Violeti's fame.
     Technologies used in the formula were actively incorporated in the FT12, a model with an elegant body line which minimized air drag and had a sensitive finishing touch.
     The transparent design showing the engine is both beautiful and effective showing its inner power."
car.FT12_GT.desc
    "While positioned as a high-performance vehicle manufacturer, Violeti didn't make any racing cars or own a race team prior to this. It has participated with the FT12 since then.
     The FT12 GT was based on the FT12, changing the body to carbon fiber, improving the FT12 and the FW12 series who's weakness was being too heavy. "
car.FW12.desc
    "There have only been 100 FT12 produced worldwide.
     As customers demanded for its production, Violeti improved on the model for mass production by adding luxury items and other options, introducing the new, FW12.
     Its slightly lower performance than the FT12 lead to a lower price tag and the added accessories attracted many customers (while lower than the FT12, it was still a supercar).
     There's an option for a hardtop, which was unusual for a supercar."
car.340s.desc
    "Yoneda, co-founder of Kaida left Kaida after the poor sales of the 320GT in 1978. He then bought 2 small automobile companies and established the Yoneda Corp.
     The 340s was the first native developed model after the company was founded.
     First introduced in 1983, the 340s had Yoneda's determination built into its stunning design.
     There were some not so positive rumors that its longer wheelbase and flowing front design showed an American style that was still influencing Yoneda.
     When these rumors were linked to Kaida, Yoneda finally cut all ties with Kaida.
     As several Japanese sports cars with a similar flowing design were released, they were loved from the late 80's to the early 90's. The design of the 340s was recognized as representing the beauty of Asia.
     The popularity of the 340s lead to its great success during the Japanese bubble in the 1980's which lead Yoneda to successfully enter the market.
     Unfortunately, both bubbles popped and the failed market for luxury cars in the 90's resulted with the company being purchased by Yamashito in the late 90's."
car.FE200R_GT.desc
    "The racing model of the FE200 series was developed by Rosel in attempt to join a league in motorsports.
     The FE200R was born and won at the French Le Bashar race, which it completed in for the first two years.
     (The Le Bashar race was a race that celebrated the Le Bashar Corp., which won the race of Paris-Marseille-Paris in 1896.)
     Rosel Corp. chose the FE200R GT's paint job that was based on the FB200, and not the FE200R, to show that this model was based on the FB200 series.
     By winning the French Le Bashar race in 1971, the Rosel Corp. finally shook off its former image of being a technological underdog.
     But it also drew suspicion from its rivals that Rosel Corp. lobbied the Le Bashar race to change the course so it would be better suited for the FE200R through its French partner, Sherborn Corp.
     This suspicion arose because of the many added steep cornering sections in the 1971 Le Bashar course."
car.FE200R.desc
    "Despite the success of the FB200 series, Rosel Corp. still had a problem.
     After World War II, the automobile industry still focused on competing over technology, building faster and more spectacular cars, rather than listening to their customer needs.
     Thus, automobile companies showed their worth in races, investing heavily in car races which lead to numerous racing competitions.
     When companies with good race records boasted their achievements, customers naturally flocked to these companies with the winning cars thinking that they were the ones with the best technology.
     While such an image was not directly related to sales, Rosal Corp. was still regarded as a technological underdog in the US market, so it needed to prove itself.
     But Rosel Corp. decided that it couldn't sacrifice its identity for luxury and economical value, so it improved the FB200 series into a race grade model, which would lead to the FE200 series.
     Another reason to show that the FB200 and the FE200 were both efficient and high powered.
     The FE200 series was similar in design because it used the same assembly line as the FB200. This lead to the FB200's having standardized components and lowered the cost and increased profits. It event increased its power and durability by more than 10%.
     In the future, the FE200R would become the pillar of the Rosel Corp. during the energy crisis that affected the entire world in 1970."
car.FB200R.desc
    "The model which was the foundation of today's Rosel.
     After World War II, the American automobile industry concentrated on larger cars with more accessories due to war not taking place on American soil.
     But in England, where Rosel Corp. was located, most of Europe's industrial capacities were destroyed, which forced automobile designers to consider more economical aspects of car designs.
     This is why Rosel collaborated with Sherborn from France to introduce the FB100 series in the early 1960's.
     Rosel Corp. mainly produced military motorcycles during the war, giving its expertise on smaller engines which allowed for a good synergy between Sherborn's design.
     But the FB100 series didn't appeal to the American market where larger cars dominated. Also, the loud noise from the car brought high criticism from Europe as well.
     Never the less, Rosel Corp. saw the potential need of customers focusing on both design, economy, and design. So it fixed the noise and added luxury accessories, giving birth to the FB200 series.
     The FB200 series steadily maintained its market value in Europe, creating a the foundation for the FE200 series."
car.320GT.desc
    "The last model made by Yoneda Tomi in 1978, before he left Kaida and founded Yoneda Corp.
     Yoneda Tomi is the co-founder of Kaida. When cars became popular among the middle class in the late 1970's, Kaida changed its strategy to concentrate on models that would appeal to the general public.
     But since developing cars with the use of reverse engineering, Yoneda Tomi was obsessed with self-development.
     He personally oversaw the production, not allowing any cheap or unreliable parts to be used.
     Such a habit was bad for company profits and caused much tension between management.
     As the 320 GT's sales were less than expected (not terrible, but the low-profit ratio made it look worse than it really was),
     Management was unhappy and Yoneda Tomi decided to leave the company.
     Even now, the 320 GT is still loved by up and coming racers. Its design puts performance as its number priority.
     Unlike today's trend of safety or luxury, the 320 GT concentrated on performance, so its potential to be the best car when handled correctly is still present.
     So it became a car that any would be professional racer would want.
     A car that trains the driver - 320 GT!"
car.Autumn_II.desc
    "A model introduced in 1998 by well known Japanese car manufacture Kaida.
     The Season Project was Kaida's plan to target the city car market in the 1970's, which went on from spring, summer, and autumn.
     As Japan's bubble economy in the late 70's increased and the demand for larger, foreign vehicles rose, Kaida's production also shifted to larger sedans, halting the Season Project.
     In the late 80's, the bubble popped returning the demand for city cars.
     As Kaida resumed the Season Project, Hashimoto, who headed the project and now as the technology director, celebrated the autumn season by introducing the Autumn II, a modern designed city car.
     Autumn II was designed was minimized as much as possible while maintaining high mileage and stability due to the complex roads and congestion in Japan. Its comfortable seats, easy parking ability with a high-quality paint job appealed well to female customers. It sold 1 million units worldwide just after 2 years of being release.
     It's said that Kaida was covertly working on the Autumn III based on the success."
car.Blizzard.desc
    "Fermo Corp., which was hindered by the Stradi Corp. due to Griffone's success, finally introduced a new high-end model.
     While the Stradi Corp. focused on relatively light and sporty vehicles, the Fermo Corp. introduced the Blizzard, mounting a high powered engine and maximizing its aerodynamic design, worthy enough to be called a true machine.
     Fermo Corp.'s bold decision to use four-wheel drive in an MR was also well received.
     While its majestic, stunning power appealed well to the global market, its few production options and high price tag lead to low sale numbers."
car.Meteor.desc
    "The Italian car company, Violeti produced a 4-seat coupe made in 2003.
     After purchasing the Carrozzeria Juzia design, Violeti decided to continue their mid-level sports car, the Orca as its mass production model.
     Codename Orca was a high-performance 4-seat coupe that was later officially named Meteor and was introduced in 1998 to the market.
     Unfortunately, the Meteor stopped production only after a year. It was a example of the failed collaboration between Carrozzeria and its mass producer, Violeti.
     Even after the Meteor's failure, Violeti decided that the Meteor proved to have some potential of applying the Juzia design into mass production, moving to other models.
     Violeti resumed mass production of the coupe project with the Meteor-S.
     The Meteor-S distinguishes itself from other competitors' coupe models by offering suspension, anti-rolling bar, racing brakes, sport-type wheels and other sports package options.
     Such a various sports option package from the manufacturer allowed for an official A/S, unlike other companies. It appealed to the general public who were concerned with third-party tuning."
car.Musai.desc
    "The Japanese automobile industry began to design cars in the 1960's, and the rise of the domestic economy brought in the golden age of Japanese cars.
     While the early attempts failed due government regulations, they turned to the domestic market and concentrated on customer needs and productivity.
     While picky Japanese customers made the products evolve, the American and European markets tried to protect their own industries with regulations that would ultimately fail.
     These protective measures actually made their industries more susceptible, allowing the Japanese automobile industry to deal a massive blow in the 80's.
     The Musai was introduced in 79' by Yamashito. It shows how Japanese companies worked hard to meet the demands of the domestic market.
     The Musai was a model on which Yamashito's engineers wanted to bring an artistic value to a car. The name came from Greek mythology, the muse (the plural being Musai).
     As the name suggests, the Japanese were very proud of their cars.
     The majority of the chassis were built through craftworking, differing from other highly productive Japanese cars.
     This also caused the high price tag causing it to not sell very well in the market.
     But the Musai's beauty and quality from the master workmanship is still remembered by collectors."
car.S24.desc
    "A high-performance sedan introduced in 2004 by the German company, GAU (Hannover Auto Union, an alliance of 3 automobile companies based in Hannover. It's a well known German high-end mass produced brand with a solid market status).
     The appearance is similar to that of a normal-medium sedan, but the performance hidden inside is truly a beast of a machine.
     The S24 was introduced as the fastest mass-produced car equipped with a 4WD system which was a rarity for sedans in the past.
     One disadvantage was that the basic suspension was a bit unstable during high-speed cornering, but it was found that because of the increased weight from the 4WD and luxury options. It was unavoidable to secure both the luxury of a sedan and the high-performance of a race car."
car.Am4.desc
    "The 4th model of the roadster series that was first introduced in 1986 by the renowned German automobile company, MMW.
     MMW was founded in the 1890's and has a rich history spanning over a century. It was the best automobile brand in Germany.
     The producer of various sports car models with a huge amount of accumulated experience from numerous races, MMW introduced new lineups in 1986 even suitable for the 21st century. The A series was one of the roadster lineups among them.
     The smooth and sporty design combined with the strong accelerating power capable of reaching 0-100kmph in 6.7 seconds was met with outstanding recognition.
     A new type was introduced every 5 years since then, and in 1999, the AM4 was introduced. Contrary to its predecessors, the AM4 was released only after 3 years and 8 months, surprising the market.
     While it was good news for customers waiting for the new A series, it was widely believed that the AM4's release was shortened by a year due to GAU's new model.
     The quick release may have influenced the AM4's early clutch system problem which ended up with a recall.
     It was a crucial blow to MMW, which had maintained its image of being the premier brand in Germany.
     Some analysts even criticized that the AM4's design was poor due to the shortened development period.
     Because of this, sales were lower than any other A series before, even with the high price tag.
     But later on, it would be recognized for having higher performance far above other mass-produced sports cars of that era."
car.FE200R_GT_U.desc
    "This was the model that Rosel Corp. used to win the Le Bashar Race in 1972.
     Also being the previous winner as well, it sported a splendid paint job and pushed out a stronger performance than times past.
     By winning the same race consecutively for 2 years, Rosel Corp. shook off the rumors of the previous year and rose to the top of all automobile makers.
     With the global energy crisis, customers turned to the more fuel-efficient and more comfortable FE200R, giving this foreign car with the highest market share in the US until Japanese cars took over after the 1980's.
     The FE200R's records also helped the FE200R GT-U's sales as well.
     This model still demands respect among automobile lovers for its design and performance."
car.C30.desc
    "The most renowned French automobile brand is the 2002 Sherborn Coupe.
     Strong at producing small to mid-sized cars, Sherborn introduced several unique designs based on a French philosophy.
     The C30, launched in 2002, had sharp lines from headlamp to the hood, and the higher rear design for larger cargo storage made for securing both aggressive and luxury at the same time.
     The stable performance, large driver's seat and cargo compartment made it popular among the younger generation and is still widely popular even to this day.
     As it targeted a younger audience, the color ranged from light pastel tones to more general colors.
     The 6-speed transmission and 170 HP is enough to satisfy even the most hardened racing enthusiasts, but it had a design flaw. The transmission was weak when it hit beyond the 4th speed, hindering acceleration."
car.RC30.desc
    "The successor of the C30. While the exterior is similar to its predecessor, it has been redesigned for better performance due to the opinion that C30's actual performance does not match its aggressive design.
     Thus, apart from its looks, both are actually completely different models. Since the design was already highly regarded, the focus of this model was to improve performance. Mounting turbines as standard, it earned the nickname, Wolf in sheep's clothing. Among the most balanced of the mass-produced coupes, it had superb performance among its peers.
     The fans were delighted with the model and a variety of tuning parts was also supported. But since its price was higher than its predecessor, it was not well received by the general public. Nevertheless, the perfect design of the C30 was enhanced by improving the performance of the RC30 allowing it to become a truly powerful machine.
     For Sherborn, it was the first model to compete in the high-performance market.
     Even today racing enthusiasts who focus on performance rather than appearance or luxury usually picks the RC30 as the best car for tuning.
     It's also most frequently seen in amateur racing competitions."
car.Terra.desc
    "Its origin is unclear, but its unexpected sales allowed for Kaida to build a strong city car lineup since the Autumn II.
     After New Autumn failed in the 80's, the city car business wasn't stable even within Kaida.
     Nevertheless, development for the next successor of the Autumn kept moving forward.
     Due to the bad Japanese economy, several release delays occurred. Kaida's internal reports suggested that the design was outdated in 1992, the year the Terra was released (Even with the launch event of Terra, it was the smallest one in Kaida's history).
     But as the Japanese economy bubble popped in the 90's, it gained popularity of the general public and its rare options of cheap sunroofs made it a steady seller.
     The decision to add various luxury options was rare for city cars, but its outdated design proved to be a great move for Kaida.
     Terra's success made an impression on Kaida's overall sales policy, and the future of Kaida models would provide a wider range of luxury options as well."
car.New_Autumn.desc
    "A model that was introduced in the mid-1980's. It was based on the Autumn, Kaida's 3rd model of his city car project called 'Season.'
     Dorao Hashimoto, the chief engineer of project Season was working as the technical advisor of Kaida in the USA, so he was not directly involved with New Autumn (Some say this is why he felt he was responsible for the failure of New Autumn and managed the Autumn II).
     Despite the average performance compared to the competing city cars, its stagnant design took its toll.
     Due to the economic boom in Japan, city cars were not well received, so its sales were a merely 2,000 units before it was discontinued."
car.Allowette.desc
    "A model introduced by Suzukoza in late 2003. It won the customer satisfaction award for city cars in 2004.
     Suzukoza's distinct sleek design was prevalent and combined a smooth line from the front bumper to the bonnet. It also had aggressive headlamps that resembled an image of a submissive yet cold Japanese woman, which became very popular among the working woman.
     There were opinions that allowed for the interior and cargo compartments to be smaller, but it wasn't a big issue since most city cars were used for driving alone.
     The 20km mileage per liter in the urban environment was a perfect model for the stagnating economy and for people wanted to save money in Japan.
     Unfortunately, the same small compartments and interior didn't sell so well overseas. "

     Drossel, a car with a sharp front design was chosen as the official car of the 2006 World Cup in Germany and was to be supplied to each staff member of every team.
     Its wide front seats, despite being a 2-door city vehicle, was its strongest advantage. It provided optimal driving environments for its drivers.
     The automatic air conditioner, seat control, and navigation were all provided as stock, appealing to the younger crowd who valued luxury as much as performance.
     Apart from that, the rear light's upper positioning that was due to safety measures that were taken made the trunk door uncomfortable for cargo loading, and the utility of the trunk and rear seat were lower than other city cars."

    "Fortta released this model in 2003 in accordance with the Italian city car promotion policy, which was started in the late 90's to solve traffic congestion and lack of parking.
     Based on a 2-seat chassis, its rear seats were foldable, allowing for a large cargo compartment or more passenger space.
     Contrary to other previous city cars, its appliance of the rigid frame technology over the entire chassis allowed for the use a larger door.
     This solved the discomfort of the entrance of most city cars, and the higher stiffness allowed for better endurance during various power tuning.
     This made it ideal for amateur city car races.
     The large wheel compared to a sporty and toy-like design made the car more stable, which was well-received by critics.
     After the introduction in 2003, the Tango was the best selling city car for 2 years straight and some said its splendid paint job made the Italian cities more colorful."
car.SLM.desc
    "A sports sedan from MMW that was released in 2000.
     While it was actually the successor to the AM4 line, the main designer of the AM series had been replaced by Samuel Land (One of the chief designers from US Krant. He was one of the designers with one of the best selling cars in the US market).      The series number was discarded for the new name, SL which were both the initials of the designer and 'Super Liberal.'
     While the recent trend was always to include, high performance as a feature back in the 2000's, when SLM was first introduced, it was famous as one of the Budget-friendly high performance vehicles. (Meaning it was relatively cheaper than similar performance cars on the market.)
     Using a larger displacement engine for its size lead to a heavier weight, but this was a trivial matter for customers who just wanted both a powerful engine and a strong grip force.
     The model faithfully represented MMW's plan to broaden its customer base and this was done also by even hiring Samuel Land."

car.Gulliver.desc
    "It was the representative model of the renowned Japanese high-quality sedan company, Toyana in the 1970's.
     While the Toyana was a solid brand in the large sedan market with the 3000cc or higher, but back in the day, their focus wasn't on large vehicles at all.
     The Gulliver had a large chassis compared to the other competing models. Its large interior and cargo compartment was also a plus.
     While the engine's power was a bit weaker due to its weight and size, the general public loved it because it started a trend of picnicking in Japan during that time.
     Its sensitive, but still high-class paint job gave it the nickname Father's car. Many of the youth who recently got their licenses often inherited their father's Gulliver."
car.HSX.desc

     Embracing the new millennium, they decided to enter the African market. Rosel then named the FE200R's new successor, Millennium (Concept).
     Its sleek design resembling the Audi (It had a strikingly similar fuel port location). It was not so unique, but its far more realistic specs compared to other concept cars drew a good evaluation from the crowds, especially the rear design which even their rivals respected.
     This model opened Rosel's steady development of new models after the year 2000, representing the resilience of the Rosel Corp."
car.P3roadster.desc
    "A premier sports coupe that was introduced by Raxley of the United Kingdom in 2005.
     The prototype was named Harpoon because of the sharp front design resembling a missile but was later changed to Kronos because the word harpoon meant also a drug term for a syringe in the US.
     Still, it was loved by the younger generation because of its looks and power."
car.Gazelle.desc
    "Tamasoki, one of the few custom made automobile companies, introduced this model at the 2004 Japanese Car Convention.
     Tomosoki builds high-end sports cars, with almost all custom parts done in-house and builds their unique cars strictly based on customer requests.
     Unfortunately, the identity of the customer and the final product were often a secret, so only a few knew the price range of these fancy cars.
     Among car enthusiasts, only a few photos were thought to be taken while a delivery was made which was a hot topic to discuss.
     In secret, Tomosoki actually went to show off their new car at the convention in 2004, with their customer's consent.
     The production capability or the performance of Tomosoki's cars were generally well known, but the actual final product was not, so it came as a shock when they unveiled it to the general public for the first time.
     The 400 HP engine and its transparent engine room became the hot topic of the year.
     Named Gazelle after a request from an unknown South African customer. It was built on the concept of one of the few animals fast enough to evade a Cheetah encapsulating the Gazelle's speed and nimble mobility.
     Kawashima, the ex-president of Hhonda, declared that if the gazelles of Africa were similar to this car, then every cheetah would go extinct."
car.Gull.desc
    "Krant, the famous American automobile maker produced this model in the early 1970's and sold over 2,000 units. Only around 200 units are left today but are still well-known as a premium model of Krant.
     Geronimo was designed with the motto of 'make it bigger and better,' which was the philosophy of the automobile industry of the 60's and 70's. Having a larger chassis and a high-performance engine made it worthy of its nickname, 'The Machine.'
     The origin of its name, Geronimo was made famous by its engine making a sound similar to a beast roar.
     Geronimo is also the name of a legendary native American chieftain (who was actually never a chieftain, despite being a leader) and was also the phrase for valor.
     The grandson of an Apache chieftain, he was a medicine man who was well respected within his tribe.
     He later chose to fight when he lost his family to the invading Mexican army. 
     There was a theory that 'Geronimo' originated from the name Saint Jerome.
     He was called Geronimo when he defeated the Mexicans in battle.
     Similarly, Geronimo was a model that was represented by the massive roar of its engine and corresponding power."
car.M-540_Hornet.desc
    "A model introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 2004 by the well-known Italian carrozzeria manufacturer, Kesca.
     It was the modern interpretation of the popular 1970's sports car, the Shooting Star and was given its name, Hornet. The name suited it well due to its sharp and striking image.
     The leather seats and metallic dashboard gave it a premier yet fresh expression, and the unending line from the front to the rear represented the image of a hornet flying towards the enemy.
     The 557 HP engine's thundering sound and power would let anyone know why it is called the Hornet.
     In general, most carrozzeria companies were forced to concentrate on exterior design due to their lack of technology, but Kesca invested much into technological advancements from the beginning.
     As a result, its aerodynamic design is still regarded as the reason that led to the creation of a collaborative system for the design of race cars for many automakers."
car.M-545_wasp.desc
    "Thanks to the great success in the Geneva Motor Show, the Hornet sold around 1,000 units worldwide.
     After their success, Kesca became bolder and introduced the Wasp, which gave a facelift to the old design, giving it a more competitive performance boost.
     The Wasp was designed with a more modern style, but still kept some of the core concepts of the Hornet and the 1960's Shooting Star such as the traditional rear lights and overall shape.
     Using a similar name, the Wasp proved that the Hornet's value and performance would live on."
car.Zenith.desc
    "The mass-produced model of the Millennium version that was first seen at the 2000 Auto Africa.
     Its body has been enlarged compared to the concept model, but its basic design is still the same.
     The concept version's engine was set too high for its engine room size, which caused difficulty when mounting an actual engine.
     The overall enlargement allowed for a 390 HP engine, far more powerful than the concept version.
     Also, it included a variety of safety features not seen in the original concept version, such as better braking performance and airbags that were on all sides of the car, putting the safety of the driver as its number one priority. Using tires with high grip and an aerodynamic design not only brought fast acceleration performance but also superb braking ability and safety, making it the best performance model of Rosel. Its unique two-toned color went well with its image of state of the art vehicle."
car.GZ30.desc
    "The GZ30V is a model which upgraded the current design and luxury options of the G Class, giving it improved road performance using new technologies from Kraus.
     The GZ30V is the first G Class to mount the new generation V6 engine and automatic 7-speed transmission.

    "A limited edition model to celebrate the 10 million sales of Kaida's steady seller, the Terra.
     Its wide range of luxury options despite it still being a cost-efficient city car made it a steady seller. The limited edition added a turbo to its engine, and the two-toned color was received well.
     But the most distinct change that was made was that the city car now has 4wd.
     The 100 thousand units made the word 'limited' somewhat of a trick, but the two-toned Terra was the most popular car among graduating students."

     What made it unique was that it used 4WS (this reduced the turn angle by rotating the rear wheel while cornering), making it popular among car enthusiasts.
     It was more valuable because of the 4WS because it was a very difficult function to be installed.

     The first step they took was to take the Millennium to the European Championship, a prototype that was pre-engineered to transform the Millennium into a GT.
     Since this model was based on the 'Millennium Concept' and not on the 'Millennium,' its cornering performance was poor.
     This caused it not to be entered in official races, but the design of the 'Millennium' was modified as a high-performance rear wheel drive vehicle.

     They have won every year since 2002, still showing great expandability of the SLM platform.
     This car won the Rosel Circuit in 2005, which caused people to say that 'You can't outperform SLM in Rosel.'
     Its precise and clean movement as a GT allows the driver to perform any action exactly how they intend to be.
     There's no lack of power and the ability to overtake an opponent is also excellent."

     "Sponsored by 'This Is Game,' a game webzine
      
     It was first used by 'This Is Racing' team in 2005 with good results.
     The driver was a new driver who was from an elite driver training program in Korea where the motorsports market is small.
     The driver was highly regarded even after taking the pole position, but lacked experience which ended with him losing the trophy."

     We will practice starting, accelerating, and stopping - the basics of a racing cars.
     Start the car and stop the car precisely at the designated location when the lesson starts.
     
     Deviating from the course or collisions are prohibited.

ba02_name "3. Keep Note of the Braking Distance"
ba02_desc
    "In racing, deceleration is more important than acceleration.
     
     Only proper deceleration will allow for smooth acceleration.
     For proper deceleration, you must always know your car’s braking distance capability.
     
     Now let’s practice your deceleration by stopping the car at a specific location."
ba03_name "4. Automobile Layout (FF)"
ba03_desc
    "Let’s learn the characteristics of a FF vehicle this time.
     
     The forward wheel drive vehicle has a tendency to understeer, so you can feel the stiffness while handling.
     
     Understeering is a phenomenon that happens when you under turn the steering wheel and the car goes in the opposite direction."
ba04_name "5. Automobile Layout (FR)"
ba04_desc
    "Now let’s learn the characteristics of a FR vehicle.
     
     The rearward wheel drive pushes the car, so it has a tendency to oversteer.
     Oversteering is a phenomenon that happens when you overturn the steering wheel and the car turns more than you initially intended it to.
     
     The front wheels manage direction while the rear wheels move the car so it becomes more dynamic and mobile. This is one of the reasons why most sports vehicles use this type.

    "In general, slip is a phenomenon in which a car will slide due to an inertial force.
     Each slip differs based on the car’s configuration, weight, and speed. Your reaction should adapt to each situation accordingly.
     
     When turning on a large corner at high speed, the centrifugal force may tip the car sideways.
     
     In this lesson, we will learn about slip and practice dealing with such drastic situations.
     
     Doing just one, single drift point will fail the lesson.

     Here's a hint, don’t accelerate too much when the body is under an inertial force such as when you are cornering.
     Also, if you’re using a manual transmission, you could also try changing to a higher gear to accelerate more slowly when getting out of a corner.

     Accumulate 5,000 drift points while reaching the destination within 60 seconds.
     In a drift, speed, angle, and duration will be factors for additional points.
     
     With that being said, the faster, wider, and longer drifts will give higher points.

    "Most roads are designed in such a way that the inner curve is lower.
     But some old roads are actually tilted outward.
     
     When passing such sections, slip or changing the direction of the vehicle can be very dangerous.
     
     In other words, the vehicle must drive straight through these sections.

     Good braking will stabilize and bring enough speed to a vehicle when entering a corner, which will allow for plenty of reacceleration when leaving it.
     
     Sometimes, braking can cause the vehicle to lock when decelerating, causing the vehicle to understeer.
     Just firmly release the brake to recover from an understeer when this occurs.

    "Welcome to XL1 Driving School.
     
     In XL1, the arrow keys on your keyboard will be used for basic vehicle movement.
     You can also use a joystick or racing wheel through configuring via the option on the lower right of the main menu.
     
     Now, first start your car and try to stop it on the designated location on top of the hill in front of you.
     Use ↑ for acceleration and ↓ for deceleration.
     
     
     Press the confirm button below to begin.
     "
tutorial_title2 "Quick Start"
tutorial_intro2
    "Well done.
     
     Now let’s learn how to quick start your car.
     Your car may move backward down the hill, but you can use your handbrake to quickly stop your car.
     
     Use your handbrake for around 0.5 seconds, and then release the handbrake the moment you move your car.
     Take a left turn at the end of the road and stop your car at the designated site.
     
     Use the handbrake accordingly, further instructions will be shown at your next location.
     
     Use spacebar to activate the handbrake."
tutorial_title3 Curves
tutorial_intro3
    "The curves are designed to make you comfortable with the width of your car.
     
     While you should never hit a wall during a test, this time we will make an exception. Try it with confidence.
     
     After this course, stop the car at the designated site."
tutorial_title4 S-course
tutorial_intro4
    "Now, we will try the S-course which is similar to the real circuits.
     
     Try to avoid touching the boundary while you pass it.
     As before, you will not receive any penalties for touching the boundary.
     
     After this course, stop the car at the starting location.
     The next course will be a practical test, which will not allow for any collisions or deviations from the path. Practice well.
     "
tutorial_title5 "Exercise Complete"
tutorial_intro5
    "Well done.
     
     Was this really your first time?
     You’re pretty good.
     
     As a reward for your great skills, here’s a new car.
     Good luck earning better and faster cars in the future.
     
     Oh, one last thing: Never give up! Go for gold!
     "
tutorial_title6 "Exercise Results"
tutorial_intro6

     Don’t worry and just try to pass every course.
     
     
     Press the confirm button below to begin.
     "
tutorial_finish
    "Congratulations.
     
     Did you learn enough about the basic controls?
     Remember, this was only the beginning.
     
     In XL1, you can use unique techniques and strategies like using the parking brake, accel-off or even nitro.
     In more difficult courses you will learn the characteristics of each course and driving method based on the specifics of each car.
     
     "
tutorial_title7 Pit-In
tutorial_intro7
    "Due to the excessive tire wear out during a race, this car is now sidelined.
     It requires new tires. Maintenance during the race like this is called a Pit-In.
     
     There’s an entrance to the Pit on the left after turning the corner ahead.
     Enter the area, stop the car on the designated location and receive maintenance once you reach the target location.
     
     After you stop the car accordingly, the crew will take care of the rest.
     
     Since the situation is bad, a bit of collision will be acceptable."
