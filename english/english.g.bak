     She grew tired of just watching all the racing games, so she quit her job and became a racer girl. "

    " A married racer girl, you would never guess that was a mother of a 5-year old child from her good looks.
     After getting married to one of her fans, she returned to her racing career.
     Of course, she has loved all the support from her number one fan, her husband,
     but unlike the other racer girls, her female fanbase has rapidly increased after getting married. "

    " Born in 1986, she measures in at 172cm and a slender weight of 49kg.
     She’s an expert dancer that gained fame from a variety of reality TV and game shows.
     She also works as a fashion model,
     but views herself as a racer girl,
     and shares this view with most of her fans. "
girl5.desc
    " Born in 1983, she’s a rookie model who worked as a racer girl for only a year.
     She majored in Transport Designs but don't let that fool you. She's also great at driving, too taking home 1st place at an amateur racing club.
     Her long legs are her best feature giving her honors as the model with the best legs in her debut."
girl_M.desc
    " An aspiring model-to-be who majored in Korean Traditional Dance is currently training to become a model.
     She started her racer girl career for the experience in the spotlight, but the job was engaging enough for her to keep her attention.
     She’s giving it her all, but is still looking forward to the day she will debut as a fashion model. "

    "A 20-year old who is striving to be the very best in whatever she does is currently part of a racing team working as an intern driver.
     He still needs more experience, but his talents show that he has potential to be a great driver.
     Luck doesn't win races; only practice will bring him to the top."

    "A racer from the standard elite courses.
     Thanks to his father working at Keiberg Corp., he began cart racing at the age of 5.
     After growing up, he attended racing school and joined the Keiberg Junior Racing Team when he was only 14.
     While he didn’t achieve any notable records during cart racing or when on the junior racing team, his self-control and determination made him a promising racer at the age of 18.
     MMW saw his potential and signed him to their team when he qualified 3rd in the German Open Championship.
     Since moving to MMW, he has won numerous races at the height of his career.
     His driving style is very stable due to his tremendous experience and strong mental concentration.
     But some say his desire to win has been weakened.
     < Behind Story >
     His father, a mechanic for Keiberg, was a wannabe racer, but after an accident during a car test, his dream ended.
     He wanted Marco to fulfill his dream, so he invested everything in his son, Marco, even gaining the support of Keiberg Corp.
     So when Marco moved to MMW without winning the Gold Cup for Keiberg, his father became full of anguish."
driver3.desc
    "‘The rally rebel road challenger.’
     ESPN gave him that title which was front page news when he abruptly announced his retirement from his dominant reign at rally racing to focus on road racing.
     Apart from a year when he recovered from an horrendous accident, he dominated every competition since he started his career in rally racing at the age of 22.
     He currently is the 3-time, all-around winner of the WRC Rally and has won more than 50 various rallies such as the Rallye Monte Carlo and Dakar Rally.
     During interviews, he sometimes references that the race is only about competing against his car and that the other drivers aren’t even a factor at all, stirring the public.
     Outside of racing, his dysfunctional private life is full of scandals with famous celebrities, which makes him an easy target for the paparazzi.
     One time when he decided to ditch the paparazzi, he drove so fast that no one could keep up with him.
     This choice eventually ended up with Roman authorities revoking his driving license during his vacation.
     When he decided to "
        challenge the road
" he claimed that rally racing no longer had any challenge left, which baffled the public with his drastic decision.
 His situational awareness, swift reaction speed, and unorthodox driving style are his strongest skills, but it is still uncertain if his skills will transition well on the circuit.
 <Behind Story>
 There were a number of rumors that related to the reason why he left rally racing and moved to F1.
 Some thought that there were no more challenges left in rally racing for him, but others thought he was just agitated by all the rumors that he was only good at off-road racing.
 According to his co-driver and former partner for 3 years, Andrew, he met a woman named Anna during his vacation in Italy. When Martin became attracted to her, she told Martin that she would only date him if he could prove himself faster than her on the circuit. Martin responded to the claim that it was a stupid made up lie by Andrew, who was now jobless thanks to Martin. He also told the press that, "
    Andrew will never perform at that level again without me on his rally again.""

# Description of courses ##
course.Circuit01.desc
    "The track was originally used for test cars and later redesigned for racing. The two straight lines, each followed by corner give the driver the opportunity to shorten lap time. The first corner appearing right after start affects whole racing so you need high concentration in starting."
course.Circuit02.desc
    "The valley track winding with beautiful seaport is mended at times when the racing is held.It is much popular to galleries for outstanding views but it is also notorious to racers for narrow and tough valley track."
course.Circuit03.desc
    "You can feel the best speed along the road through the city streets. Though the difficulty level is medium, you should be careful of braking at the hairpin after long straight line. Long acceleration through continous straight lines makes the track very populur to galleries wishing to see best speed of the car."
course.Circuit04.desc
    "The track is very beautiful at glance from the middle of the mountain. At first, you can be mistaken that the track is easy except two hairpins, but because almost all the corners are blind corners meaning the next corner is not visible, the track has notorious nickname of Typhlopidae from the drivers."
course.Circuit05.desc
    "Though it is illegal, you can drive sling streets being repairing to prepare formula race. It is very dangerous because some parts of the road cause the optical illusion and there are many obstacles laid for repairing, but many young peoples are gathering here now to enjoy best speed."
course.Circuit06.desc "Cloudy Summit Reverse direction"
course.Circuit07.desc "Sundown Harbor is a great shipyard"
course.Circuit08.desc "Sundown Harbor-R is a great shipyard"
course.Circuit09.desc
    "The valley track winding with beautiful seaport is mended at times when the racing is held.It is much popular to galleries for outstanding views but it is also notorious to racers for narrow and tough valley track."
course.Circuit10.desc "XL Speedway was changed to jumpping course."
course.Circuit11.desc "A course designed to race along a beautiful river that runs through downtown."
course.Circuit11R.desc "A course designed to race along a beautiful river that runs through downtown."
course.Circuit12.desc
    "A massive, newly built combined circuit to promote motorsports in Korea. A variety of circuits that can be easily organized using a variety of components has given it the name, 'OnNuRi,' meaning the whole world. The test track at the edge of it is called, 'Circuit12A-Maru,' meaning sky."

     The forward wheel drive vehicle has a tendency to understeer, so you can feel the stiffness while handling.
     
     Understeering is a phenomenon that happens when you under turn the steering wheel and the car goes in the opposite direction."
ba04_name "5. Automobile Layout (FR)"
ba04_desc
    "Now let’s learn the characteristics of a FR vehicle.
     
     The rearward wheel drive pushes the car, so it has a tendency to oversteer.
     Oversteering is a phenomenon that happens when you overturn the steering wheel and the car turns more than you initially intended it to.
     
     The front wheels manage direction while the rear wheels move the car so it becomes more dynamic and mobile. This is one of the reasons why most sports vehicles use this type.
