# Clipping Point mods

a collection of some fixes and changes to the Clipping Point game, intended for the 1.0.005 patch. 

each folder is its own set of changes to the game files. the folders' changes are described here:

- `english`: finishing and fixing up the English translation. it's not done yet, but it's quite some work, as updating it involves cross-referencing many different files across different versions of the game.
  
  some parts are backported from the Steam release of the game, and some parts are translated from the `korean.g` file in the same 1.0.005 version. the Steam translation is pretty complete but sometimes missing key parts or emotion that we should preserve.  
  
  the intent is to maintain the original personality of the text as much as possible, while fixing spelling and formatting mistakes, and adding missing keys.

  **to install it**, move your existing `Resource/Data/string/english.g` file somewhere safe. then, copy the `english.g` file to that same folder.

  the `error.log` file contains some examples of errors fixed by this update to the translation. 
  
you can also see some other patches are needed for missing or moved car data.
